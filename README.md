installation:
 * install electron
 * npm install

what's going on in here
 * electron/atom is the shell around the whole thing
 * express js for serving
 * nunjucks for templating (it's like Django templates, which is DA BOMB)
 * socket.io for communications
 * lodash for dashiness
 * color for splashes of color in the logs

--
thoughts:
 * some form of UI/frontend helper, preferably one that's not too opinionated
 * maybe an event thingamahoople?


wounds are dice
mental damage are dice
heal mental damage with Worrywort
weapons are dice
everything is dice
barbarian has modified wound dice
mage has modified mental damage dice
when people die they become ghosts
ghosts can do mental damage (haunt)
players can fight, block, use an item, backstab a friend, or do their class special
